# MRR software consulting

This is a made-up company to showcase a project flow for HubSpot projects. The goal here is to create a development flow that is modern and minimally invasive to the host file system.

## Goals

- [x] Use nix flakes to create a dev environment
- [ ] Encrypt user credentials and inject into dev environment (maybe, not sure how much sense this makes)
- [ ] Use localtunnel to simulate locally running serverless functions.
- [ ] Catch shell exit and delete transient projects used for local serverless development.
- [ ] Use github workflows to reject un-formatted code.

### Reach goals
- [ ] Leverage typescript to make type-safe interactions between cards and serverless function.
